# Schedule_Website
This is a website that will have a dynamic calendar that will highlight the current day and let users add their own text to the boxes. It will also have a current day tab that users can populate and it will have a red line that shows the current time. 

When starting use "npm init -y" and then "npm install express mongoose cors".
